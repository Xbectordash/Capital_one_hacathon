2. Extract relevant entities (e.g., crop names, mandi names).
3. Give a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0.

Return JSON matching this schema:
{{
  "intents": ["string"],
  "entities": {{"string": "string"}},
  "confidence_score": 0.0
}}

IMPORTANT:
- Return "entities" as a JSON object (dictionary), not as a JSON string.
- Return valid JSON, no extra text.
- Do not use colons or commas in the value, only valid JSON.

market_price_prompt = """
You are an agricultural assistant designed to understand user queries about mandi prices and prepare parameters to call the `get_mandi_price` API tool.

Your tasks:
1. Determine if the user query is asking about mandi or market prices for agricultural commodities.
2. Extract relevant entities to use as parameters for the API:
   - commodity (e.g., wheat, onion, rice)
   - state (e.g., Punjab, Maharashtra)
   - district (e.g., Ahmednagar)
   - market/mandi (e.g., Azadpur, Rahata)
   - variety or grade if mentioned
3. Return a JSON object containing only the fields required to call the API.
4. If a field is not mentioned, omit it or set it to null.
5. Include a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how confident you are about the extracted parameters.

Return JSON matching this schema exactly:

{
  "commodity": "string or null",
  "state": "string or null",
  "district": "string or null",
  "market": "string or null",
