1. Identify possible intents (e.g., weather, soil, market, crop_health, policy).
2. Extract relevant entities (e.g., crop names, mandi names).
3. Give a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0.

Return JSON matching this schema:
{{
  "intents": ["string"],
  "entities": {{"string": "string"}},
  "confidence_score": 0.0
}}

IMPORTANT:
- Return "entities" as a JSON object (dictionary), not as a JSON string.
