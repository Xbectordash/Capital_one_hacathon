## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Integrations

#### SoilGrids API

- **Provider**: International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC)
- **Coverage**: Global soil data at 250m resolution
- **Properties**: pH, nitrogen, organic carbon, sand, clay, silt content
- **Depth**: 0-5cm surface layer analysis
- **Format**: REST API with JSON responses

#### Geocoding Service

- **Provider**: OpenStreetMap Nominatim
- **Purpose**: Convert location names to coordinates
- **Coverage**: Global location database
- **Rate Limits**: Respectful usage with proper headers

### LLM Integration

#### Prompt Engineering

The soil agent uses a specialized prompt for generating agricultural recommendations:

```
You are an expert agricultural advisor specializing in soil analysis and crop recommendations.

Based on the following soil data, provide specific, actionable crop recommendations and soil management advice for farmers:

Soil Data:
- pH Level: {ph}
- Nitrogen Content: {nitrogen}
- Organic Carbon: {organic_carbon}
- Sand Content: {sand_content}
- Clay Content: {clay_content}
- Silt Content: {silt_content}
- Soil Type: {soil_type}
- Fertility Status: {fertility_status}
- Location: {location}
```

#### Recommendation Categories

The LLM provides advice on:

- **Crop Selection**: Best varieties for specific soil types
- **Soil Improvement**: pH adjustment, nutrient enhancement
- **Fertilization**: NPK requirements based on soil analysis
- **Water Management**: Drainage and irrigation considerations
- **Seasonal Timing**: Optimal planting windows

### Data Processing

#### Soil Data Formatting

Raw SoilGrids data is converted to farmer-friendly formats:

```python
# pH: 65 (API) → 6.5 (Neutral)
# Nitrogen: 250 cg/kg → 2.5 g/kg (Medium)
# Organic Carbon: 1200 dg/kg → 1.20% (Medium)
# Texture: 450 g/kg → 45.0% sand content
```

#### Soil Type Classification

Based on sand, clay, and silt percentages:

- **Sandy**: >70% sand
- **Clay**: >40% clay
- **Silty**: >40% silt
- **Sandy Loam**: 45-70% sand, <20% clay
- **Clay Loam**: 25-40% clay
- **Loam**: Balanced mixture

#### Fertility Assessment

Multi-factor analysis:

- **pH Range**: 6.0-7.5 optimal
- **Nitrogen**: >2.0 g/kg adequate
- **Organic Carbon**: >1.0% sufficient
- **Overall Score**: Good/Moderate/Poor
