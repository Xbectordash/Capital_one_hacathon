# Soil & Crop Recommendation Agent - Quick Start Guide

## üå± What is the Soil & Crop Agent?

An AI-powered agricultural tool that analyzes soil conditions and recommends the best crops for your farm. It uses real soil data from global APIs combined with intelligent AI analysis to provide personalized farming advice.

## ‚ö° Quick Demo

```python
from graph_arc.agents_node.soil_crop_recommendation_agent import soil_crop_recommendation_agent

# Simple usage
state = {
    "location": "Delhi",
    "raw_query": "What crops should I plant?",
    "entities": {"location": "Delhi"}
}

result = soil_crop_recommendation_agent(state)
print(f"Recommended crops: {result['recommended_crops']}")
print(f"AI advice: {result['ai_recommendation']}")
```

## üéØ Sample Output

```
Location: Bangalore
Soil Analysis:
- Soil Type: Sandy Loam
- pH: 6.2 (Slightly Acidic)
- Nitrogen: 1.8 g/kg (Low)
- Organic Carbon: 0.9% (Low)
- Fertility Status: Moderate

Recommended Crops: Groundnut, Millet, Tomato, Onion, Beans

AI Recommendation:
"Your sandy loam soil in Bangalore shows moderate fertility with slightly acidic pH. To optimize yields, I recommend incorporating organic matter through compost or green manure. Consider crops like groundnut, millet, and vegetables that tolerate lower nitrogen levels. Apply lime to raise pH gradually and use nitrogen-rich fertilizers for better crop performance."
```

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Agent returns "N/A" for soil type**
A: This indicates API data is unavailable. The system automatically uses fallback data.

**Q: Recommendations seem generic**
A: Check if your location is specific enough. Try "District, State" format.

**Q: Tests fail with network errors**
A: APIs might be temporarily unavailable. Tests include both mocked and real API modes.

### Debug Mode

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Detailed logging will show API calls and data processing
result = soil_crop_recommendation_agent(state)
```
